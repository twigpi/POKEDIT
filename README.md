# POKEDIT
QBASIC project circa 2007 to edit save file of Pokémon LeafGreen (and later Pokémon Emerald).
Not recommended to use today (ie DO NOT USE) as it has long been superseded by programs like pokesav.
Also, younger me did not think to document the code, so it is somewhat cryptic to read in its current state.
Additionally, advanced hardware setup is required.
Also, no one used QBASIC anymore, so there's that.
